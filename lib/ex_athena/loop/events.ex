defmodule ExAthena.Loop.Events do
  @moduledoc """
  Flat, pattern-matchable event tuples the loop emits to `:on_event`.

  Event shape inspired by `ash_ai`'s `ToolLoop.stream/2` — one tuple per
  logical event, exhaustive, easy to match on in LiveView handlers, OTel
  emitters, and cost trackers. Same events feed the OpenTelemetry span
  emitter (landing in PR 4).

  Events:

    * `{:content, text}` — partial or full assistant text.
    * `{:thinking, text}` — partial or full model reasoning/thinking
      content (Anthropic `thinking` blocks, OpenAI `reasoning`
      content). Distinct from `:content` so hosts can display it
      separately (e.g. in a side pane).
    * `{:tool_call, ToolCall.t()}` — model requested a tool call.
    * `{:tool_result, ToolResult.t()}` — tool produced a result (or error).
    * `{:tool_ui, %{tool_call_id:, kind:, payload:}}` — structured UI
      payload for hosts that render rich previews (diffs, file
      contents, process output). Only emitted when a tool returns
      the `{:ok, %{llm:, ui:}}` shape; the LLM-facing string still
      flows through `:tool_result`.
    * `{:iteration, n}` — a new iteration is starting.
    * `{:compaction, %{before:, after:, reason:}}` — context compacted.
    * `{:max_tokens_escalation, %{from:, to:, output_tokens:,
      reasoning_tokens:}}` — the previous turn was output-starved (the
      whole completion budget went to reasoning, no visible output); the
      kernel is retrying the iteration once with the escalated completion
      cap. Analogous to `{:compaction, …}` on the prompt-too-long recovery
      path — hosts can render a "raising thinking budget" state.
    * `{:subagent_spawn, %{id:, prompt:}}` — a sub-agent started.
    * `{:subagent_result, %{id:, text:}}` — sub-agent returned.
    * `{:conclusion, %{iteration:, text:, source:}}` — the iteration's
      one-line conclusion (see `ExAthena.Conclusions`). `source` is
      `:stated` (model used the CONCLUSION marker), `:tail` (final
      paragraph fallback), or `:derived` (synthesized from tool activity).
      Hosts render these as a progress timeline.
    * `{:queue_wait, %{provider:, status:, waited_ms?}}` — the loop's next
      provider call is blocked waiting for a request-queue slot
      (`status: :waiting`), or just obtained one after a wait
      (`status: :acquired`, with `waited_ms`). Only emitted when the call
      actually blocks — a free slot produces no events. Hosts use this to
      render a "waiting on GPU" state for runs queued behind other loops.
    * `{:usage, usage_map}` — partial usage report from the provider.
    * `{:structured_retry, %{attempt:, error:}}` — extract_structured
      retry.
    * `{:error, reason}` — non-fatal warning (the loop continues).
    * `{:submitted, deliverable}` — the model called the `finish` tool to
      declare completion. `deliverable` is the payload passed to the tool
      (`nil` when no deliverable was provided). Emitted just before
      `{:done, Result}` when `finish_reason` is `:submitted`.
    * `{:done, Result.t()}` — terminal event. Always the last event
      emitted; the Result carries the finish_reason.

  @doc """
  Build a `{callback, counters}` pair that translates provider-side
  `ExAthena.Streaming.Event` structs into host-side Loop event tuples.

  Providers speak `%Streaming.Event{}` structs; host UIs speak flat Loop
  tuples like `{:content, text}` and `{:thinking, text}`. This callback
  bridges the two so modes can wire a provider stream directly to an
  `on_event` callback without manually pattern-matching every event type.

  The returned `counters` (an `:counters` table with 2 slots) track how many
  text/thinking deltas have been forwarded:

    * Slot 1 — text delta count
    * Slot 2 — thinking delta count

  Modes use these counters to suppress their end-of-turn full-text emission
  when streaming deltas have already been delivered to the host, avoiding
  duplicate content.

  ## Mapping

    * `:text_delta` with binary data → increments slot 1, emits `{:content, t}`
    * `:thinking_delta` with binary data → increments slot 2, emits `{:thinking, t}`
    * `:tool_call_end` when `forward_tool_events: true` → emits `{:tool_call, data}`
    * `:tool_result` when `forward_tool_events: true` → emits `{:tool_result, data}`
    * All other events (`:start`, `:stop`, `:usage`, `:error`,
      `:tool_call_start`, `:tool_call_delta`, and tool events when forwarding
      is off) → `:ok`, nothing emitted, counters untouched

  `:usage` is intentionally dropped here because modes emit it once from the
  final `Response` struct, which has complete accounting. `:tool_call_start`
  and `:tool_call_delta` are dropped because hosts receive complete tool
  events via `:tool_call`.

  ## Options

    * `:forward_tool_events` (boolean, default `false`) — when `true`, forwards
      `:tool_call_end` and `:tool_result` events to the host callback.
    * `:filter_tool_fences` (boolean, default `false`) — when `true`, text
      deltas are run through `ExAthena.Loop.FenceFilter` so `~~~tool_call`
      fenced blocks (the TextTagged protocol used by non-native-tool-call
      providers) never reach the host as visible `{:content, _}` text; the
      loop surfaces the parsed calls as `{:tool_call, _}` events instead.
      `{:content, visible}` is emitted only when the filtered text is
      non-empty, but counter slot 1 still increments on every raw text
      delta — the end-of-turn full-text suppression must stay armed because
      the full `response.text` may also contain fences. On `:stop` the
      filter is flushed and any held tail is emitted as `{:content, tail}`
      (`:stop` itself remains untranslated). Filter state lives in the
      process dictionary under a per-callback unique key; this relies on
      the provider invoking the callback synchronously from a single
      process (mock, req_llm, and claude_code all reduce the stream
      in-process). `:thinking_delta` is never filtered.

      on_event = fn event -> send(parent, {:evt, event}) end
      {cb, counters} = Events.provider_stream_callback(on_event)
