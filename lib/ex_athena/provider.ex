defmodule ExAthena.Provider do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour every provider must implement.

  A provider is a thin adapter between `ExAthena.Request` and a remote (or
  local) inference endpoint. It is expected to:

    1. Normalise the request into the provider's native wire format.
    2. Perform the HTTP call (or SDK call, for Claude).
    3. Parse the response (or stream) back into an `ExAthena.Response` /
       `ExAthena.Streaming.Event` sequence.
    4. Surface errors as `{:error, %ExAthena.Error{}}` tuples using the
       canonical kinds.

  ## Capabilities

  Each provider declares its capabilities statically. The loop uses these to
  decide the tool-call protocol and fallback strategy. See
  `ExAthena.Capabilities` for the shape.
