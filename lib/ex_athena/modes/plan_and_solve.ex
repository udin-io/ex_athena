defmodule ExAthena.Modes.PlanAndSolve do
  @moduledoc """
  Plan-and-Solve mode.

  Two-phase operation: on the first iteration, the agent is asked to
  **plan** before it acts. Subsequent iterations execute the plan using
  `ExAthena.Modes.ReAct`'s standard cycle.

  Rationale (Plan-and-Solve literature): models produce better
  tool-calling behaviour when they articulate a plan before diving into
  actions. Forcing the first turn to be planning-only prevents the
  "immediate tool call" failure mode you see with small models on
  complex prompts.

  ## State

  Plan-mode state is kept in `state.mode_state[:phase]`:

    * `:planning` — on the first iteration. A planning-only system-prompt
      addendum is injected, forbidding tool calls.
    * `:executing` — subsequent iterations fall through to the ReAct
      cycle.

  ## Configuration

      ExAthena.run(prompt, mode: :plan_and_solve, …)

  No extra options. The planning system prompt is hardcoded; consumers
  who want a custom planning instruction should implement their own Mode
  (the `ReAct` module is 200 lines of reference).

  ## Planning phase

  Before you take any action, produce a plan. Your response this turn
  MUST be plain text with no tool calls. Structure your plan as:

    1. **Goal** — what is the user asking for?
    2. **Approach** — how will you get there? Which tools will you need,
       in what order?
    3. **Risks** — what could go wrong, and how will you detect + recover?

  Once you finish your plan, wait for the next turn to begin executing.
