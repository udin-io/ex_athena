defmodule ExAthena.Tools.SpawnAgent do
  @moduledoc """
  Synchronously run a sub-agent-loop with its own prompt, tools, and budget.

  Useful for delegating a bounded task (exploring a codebase, summarising a
  file) to a fresh conversation with its own message history — so the parent
  loop doesn't pay the token cost of the sub-task's intermediate steps.

  Arguments:

    * `prompt` (required) — the sub-agent's opening message.
    * `agent` (optional) — name of an `ExAthena.Agents` definition (e.g.
      `"explore"`). The definition's `model`, `provider`, `tools`,
      `permissions`, `mode`, `isolation`, and system-prompt body apply
      automatically; explicit args still override.
    * `tools` (optional) — list of tool names to expose to the sub-agent; defaults
      to whatever the parent had (minus PlanMode + SpawnAgent to avoid loops).
    * `max_iterations` (optional, default 25, floored UP to 25) — worker loop budget.
    * `system_prompt` (optional) — system prompt override for the sub-agent.

  Workers ALWAYS run in the parent's working directory — there is no
  model-facing cwd arg (models passed junk paths and workers explored the
  wrong project). Hosts may still override via
  `ctx.assigns[:spawn_agent_opts][:cwd]`.

  Inherits the parent's provider / model / permissions unless overridden in
  `ctx.assigns[:spawn_agent_opts]`.

  ## Guardrail inheritance

  A child is never MORE privileged than its parent: the parent's
  confinement roots, `disallowed_tools` / `allowed_tools`, `can_use_tool`
  approval callback, phase, and deny-capable `PreToolUse` hooks are clamped
  onto every spawn. Agent definitions and model args may narrow these
  further but can never widen them — see `inherit_guardrails/2` for the
  exact combination rules and `docs/13-agents-and-subagents.md` for the
  policy.

  ## Worktree isolation

  When the chosen agent definition declares `isolation: :worktree` and the
  parent's cwd is a clean git repo with `git` on PATH, the subagent runs
  in a freshly-created worktree under `~/.cache/ex_athena/worktrees/<sess>/<name>-<n>`.
  If safety checks fail, the subagent transparently falls back to
  `:in_process` — no error.

  # ── Parent guardrail inheritance (issue #130) ─────────────────────
  #
  # SECURITY INVARIANT: a child may be NARROWER than its parent but never
  # MORE privileged. Agent definitions and model-supplied args can restrict
  # a worker further; nothing they say can escape the parent's confinement
  # roots, tool deny/allow lists, approval callback, phase, or PreToolUse
  # deny hooks. Concretely:
  #
  #   * allowed_roots — a confined parent confines every child. A requested
  #     root survives only if it lies inside a parent root (intersection);
  #     otherwise the child gets the parent's roots verbatim. (The child
  #     loop still cwd-anchors its roots, so a worktree-isolated child can
  #     reach its own worktree — that is the one deliberate widening, and it
  #     is host-controlled, never model-controlled.)
  #   * disallowed_tools — union of parent's and child's (deny always wins).
  #   * allowed_tools — intersection when both exist; parent's when only the
  #     parent has one.
  #   * can_use_tool — inherited unless the HOST already supplied one via
  #     spawn_agent_opts (the host is trusted; the model cannot set this).
  #   * phase — clamped to the more restrictive of parent's and requested
  #     (see Permissions.most_restrictive_phase/2). A :plan parent can only
  #     spawn :plan children; a definition may still narrow (:default parent
  #     → :plan child).
  #   * hooks — ONLY the parent's PreToolUse groups are inherited (they are
  #     part of the permission gate). Other hook events are deliberately NOT
  #     inherited: they may assume parent context (Stop hooks persisting
  #     parent session state, SessionEnd cleanup, …). Hosts wanting full
  #     hook inheritance can pass a hooks table in spawn_agent_opts.
