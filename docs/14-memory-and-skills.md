# 14 · Memory & Skills — File-Based Context

> **What this answers:** how do `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `SKILL.md` get into the conversation? When are skills loaded vs just advertised?
> **Audience:** consumers structuring project context; contributors maintaining discovery.

## The discovery pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  start([Loop.run/2]) --> memOpt{opts memory}
  memOpt -- false --> noMem[skip memory]
  memOpt -- list --> useList[use explicit list]
  memOpt -- :auto default --> mem[Memory.discover cwd]
  mem --> file1[cwd/AGENTS.md]
  mem --> file2[cwd/CLAUDE.md]
  mem --> file3[~/.config/ex_athena/AGENTS.md]
  mem --> file4[~/.config/ex_athena/CLAUDE.md]
  file1 & file2 & file3 & file4 --> msgs[prepend as user-context messages]

  start --> skillOpt{opts skills}
  skillOpt -- false --> noSk[skip skills]
  skillOpt -- map --> useMap[use explicit map]
  skillOpt -- :auto default --> sk[Skills.discover cwd]
  sk --> sdir1[cwd/.exathena/skills/]
  sk --> sdir2[~/.config/ex_athena/skills/]
  sdir1 & sdir2 --> parse[Parse SKILL.md frontmatter]
  parse --> cat[catalog_section : 50-token descriptors]
  cat --> sysprompt[Append to system prompt]
  parse --> store[Hold full bodies in meta.skills]
  store --> lazy[Lazy-load on skill: name sentinel]

  msgs --> ready
  sysprompt --> ready
```

## Memory — `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`

The full content of these files is **prepended to the conversation as `user` messages** before the actual user prompt. They establish project context, conventions, and rules the model should follow.

Discovery order:

1. `<cwd>/AGENTS.md`
2. `<cwd>/CLAUDE.md`
3. `~/.config/ex_athena/AGENTS.md`
4. `~/.config/ex_athena/CLAUDE.md`

All files found are concatenated in this order. Both names are recognised; `AGENTS.md` is the convention; `CLAUDE.md` is supported for compatibility.

### Override per-run

```elixir
# Skip memory entirely
ExAthena.run(prompt, memory: false)

# Provide explicit messages
ExAthena.run(prompt, memory: [Messages.user("repo-specific rules here")])

# Default — auto discovery
ExAthena.run(prompt)   # implicitly memory: :auto
```

---

## Skills — `SKILL.md`

Skills are **lazy-loaded capabilities**. ExAthena advertises a short descriptor in the system prompt and reveals the full body only when the model asks for it — by calling the `skill` tool, or by writing a `[skill: name]` sentinel in its response.

This keeps the system prompt small (~50 tokens per skill) regardless of how many skills exist, while still making every one discoverable.

### Skill file layout

```
.exathena/skills/web_scraping/SKILL.md
```

```yaml
---
name: web_scraping
description: How to fetch and parse web pages — includes selectors for common sites.
---

When you need to fetch a web page:

1. Use `web_fetch` to get the raw HTML.
2. Parse with `LazyHTML.from_document/1` then `LazyHTML.filter/2`.
3. For paginated content, …
```

### Catalog section (added to system prompt)

```text
## Available Skills

Call the `skill` tool with a skill's name to load its full instructions, before you start the work it covers.

  - `web_scraping` — How to fetch and parse web pages — includes selectors for common sites.
  - `linear_api` — Authenticated Linear API patterns.
```

About 50 tokens per skill thanks to the description budget.

The catalog names one mechanism: the `skill` tool when the run granted it, the sentinel when it did not. The sentinel keeps working either way — it is the fallback for providers with no native tool calls — but a catalog offering two ways to do one thing invites the weaker one.

### Lazy loading

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant LLM as Model
  participant L as Loop
  participant Sk as Skills

  LLM-->>L: skill(name: "web_scraping"), or "[skill: web_scraping]" in the text
  L->>Sk: activation_message/2
  Sk-->>L: full SKILL.md body, tagged skill:web_scraping
  L->>L: append as a system message
  L->>LLM: next turn — full skill now in context
```

Source: [`ExAthena.Skills`](../lib/ex_athena/skills.ex), [`ExAthena.Tools.Skill`](../lib/ex_athena/tools/skill.ex). Both entry points end at `activation_message/2`, so the body arrives identically whichever asked for it and `loaded_skills/1` counts it once — naming the same skill by tool and by sentinel loads it one time.

Two things the tool does not do: it does not return the body itself (the loop attaches it, as `plan_mode` has the loop apply its phase change), and it does not load a skill marked `disable-model-invocation` — neither does the sentinel. `preload/3` still can: the host is not the model.

An unknown name comes back as a tool error listing the names that do exist, so the model corrects itself instead of giving up on skills. Issue 247 has the session where it gave up: two unknown-tool errors for `skill: architecture-brief-and-mocks`, then the work done from the one-line descriptions alone.

### Preload skills

If you know a skill will be needed up front, skip the round-trip entirely:

```elixir
ExAthena.run(prompt, preload_skills: ["web_scraping"])
```

Source: [`Loop.run/2`](../lib/ex_athena/loop.ex#L70), [`Skills.preload/3`](../lib/ex_athena/skills.ex).

### Override skills

```elixir
# Skip skills
ExAthena.run(prompt, skills: false)

# Explicit map
ExAthena.run(prompt, skills: %{
  "my_skill" => %ExAthena.Skills.Skill{name: "my_skill", description: "…", body: "…"}
})

# Default
ExAthena.run(prompt)   # implicitly skills: :auto
```

## Where memory + skills end up in the message list

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  build[build_initial_state] --> mem[memory_messages]
  build --> pre[preloaded_skills]
  build --> req[request_template.messages<br/>= system_prompt + user prompt]
  mem --> initial[initial_messages]
  pre --> initial
  req --> initial
  initial --> ups[UserPromptSubmit hook can transform prompt or inject more]
  ups --> state[Loop.State.messages]
```

Order matters: memory first (project-level rules), then preloaded skills, then the request template (system prompt + user prompt). `UserPromptSubmit` hooks fire last and may transform the final user message.

The skills *catalog* (~50 tokens per skill) ends up in the **system prompt**, not as a user message. Only full skill bodies that get loaded (preload or sentinel) live as user-context messages.

Source: [`Loop.build_initial_state/2`](../lib/ex_athena/loop.ex#L493).

## Contributor notes

- **`AGENTS.md` vs `CLAUDE.md`**: both names recognised; pick one per repo. ExAthena treats them identically. `AGENTS.md` is the convention.
- **No magic in memory files**: they're plain Markdown. No frontmatter, no execution.
- **Skill bodies are *user* messages, not system**: the system prompt is reserved for catalog descriptors. This keeps the prompt small and lets the model recall skills later via the message log.
- **Skill names must be unique**: cwd skills override `~/.config/ex_athena/skills/` of the same name. Discovery merges with cwd winning.
- **50-token budget for descriptions**: descriptions get truncated when they exceed the budget. Keep them tight.
- **Preload sparingly**: preloading every skill defeats the lazy-load mechanism. Only preload if you know the model needs it from turn 1.
- **`meta.skills` vs `meta.preloaded_skill_count`**: full skills catalog lives in `meta.skills`; the count of preloaded ones is in `meta.preloaded_skill_count`. The Compactor knows about both for pinning math.
